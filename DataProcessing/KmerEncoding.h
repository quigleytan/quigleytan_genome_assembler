/*
 * KmerEncoding.h
 * Created by Tanner Quigley on 1/30/2026.
 * Summary:
 * - Static class for encoding and rolling k-mers from DNA sequences.
 * - Rolling saves time by building on previous k-mer encoding.
 * - Primary function is to provide utility for encoding a kmer and also
 *   to encode an entire sequence into a KmerTable.
 * Important notes:
 * - Uses the key: A = 00, C = 01, G = 10, T = 11 for 2-bit encoding.
 * - All encoded kmers are stored as __uint128_t.
 * - Used for quick storage and retrieval in hash tables.
