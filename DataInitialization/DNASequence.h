/*
 * DNASequence.h
 * Summary:
 * - Represents a DNA sequence and provides analysis of its composition.
 * Features:
 * - Stores a DNA sequence (immutable once constructed).
 * - Computes the complement.
 * - Computes GC count and GC percent.
 * - Throws DNASequenceException for an invalid sequence input.
 * Additional:
 * - Internally uses a helper struct AnalysisResult for single-pass computation.
 * - All internal methods and structs are private.
 * TODO items for future work:
 * - Include to_string or summary function.
