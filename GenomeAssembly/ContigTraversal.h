/*
* ContigTraversal.h
 * Created by Tanner Quigley on 3/18/2026
 * Summary:
 * - Traverses a DeBruijnGraph to extract contiguous DNA fragments (contigs).
 * - Contigs are produced in two phases: branch points and source nodes first,
 *   then isolated cycles unreachable from external entry points.
 * - All contigs include k-1 overlapping bases at boundaries for scaffolding.
 * Important notes:
 * - Operates on an already-constructed DeBruijnGraph passed by reference.
 * - Contig sequences are produced in overlap mode — boundary nodes contribute
 *   their full k-1 chars to adjacent contigs.
 * TODO: Build in handling for starting traversal at "sinks".
