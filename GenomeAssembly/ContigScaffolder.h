/*
 * ContigScaffolder.h
 * Created by Tanner Quigley
 * Summary:
 * - Orders contigs into scaffolds using shared boundary node relationships.
 * - Supports multiple branch resolution strategies for comparison.
 * Important notes:
 * - Operates on contigs produced by ContigTraversal.
 * - Scaffolds are ordered lists of contig indices with gap estimates.
 * - Ambiguous branch points are handled according to ResolutionStrategy.
 * - KmerFrequency and OverlapQuality scoring require an optional KmerTable.
 *   If none is provided, those metrics are skipped and weight falls to Length.
