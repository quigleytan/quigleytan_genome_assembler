/*
 * EulerianTraversal.h
 * Created by Tanner Quigley on 2/15/2026
 * Summary:
 * - Computes an Eulerian path or circuit through a DeBruijnGraph using
 *   Hierholzer's algorithm, visiting every edge exactly once.
 * - Reconstructs a DNA sequence string from the resulting node path.
 * Important notes:
 * - Requires a valid Eulerian graph — exactly one node with outDegree - inDegree == 1
 *   for a path, or all nodes balanced for a circuit.
 * - computePath() must be called before getPath() or reconstructGenome().
